# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets for the VirtualFit application.

## Directory Structure

- `garments/` - Contains images of garments available for virtual try-on
  - In a production application, these would be actual image files
  - For this demo, we're using placeholders referenced from design mockups

## Note

In a real application, you would need to:
1. Add actual image files to these directories
2. Consider using a CDN for storing and serving images
3. Implement proper image optimization
